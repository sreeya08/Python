Integrity Constraints:
--------------------
constraint means a rule to be followed while creating a table in database.
following are constraints:
----------------------
NOT NULL : ensures that a column con not be null value
UNIQUE:    Ensures that all the values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY: it indenfies a column uniquely
             it is combination of NOT NULL + UNIQUE
FOREIGN KEY: To make one table as parent and another table is child.in this situation child
             table will have common column which is exist in parent table Hence child table has
             the foreign key
              ex: persons table: parent table
                  order table: child table
CHECK: Ensures that the values in a column satisfies certain condition
DEFAULT: It sets the default value and when the user doesnot supply any value
CREATE INDEX: used to create an index on table to improve retrieval speed.

#INSERT INTO SAMPLE VALUES(101,"ANU");
SELECT * FROM SAMPLE;
#INSERT INTO SAMPLE VALUES(101,"BALU");
SELECT * FROM SAMPLE;
#DROP TABLE SAMPLE;
SHOW TABLES;
